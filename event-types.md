# Artsdata Controlled Vocabulary for Event Types

| <!-- --> | <!-- --> |
| - | - |
| Concept scheme | [adr:ArtsdataEventTypes](http://kg.artsdata.ca/resource/ArtsdataEventTypes) |
| Version | 4.0 |
| Release date | September 2025 |

This page outlines the controlled vocabulary used in the Artsdata knowledge graph to describe event types in the performing arts sector.

The facets of an event which are considered in scope for differentiating event types in version 4.0 of this vocabulary are those facets which refer to the design, format, and/or functioning of a given arts and culture event, rather than its artistic content.

Facets that are deemed “out of scope” for the Event Type Controlled Vocabulary (such as language, audience, time of year, etc.) should be represented through other means, such as: using existing Schema properties and concepts; using existing Wikidata properties and concepts; using external controlled vocabularies; and/or, creating additional Artsdata controlled vocabularies.

### Event Types

The list of types (SKOS concepts) can be viewed in the [concept scheme](http://kg.artsdata.ca/resource/ArtsdataEventTypes), in this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cwNQIHcU0iBUi2dLdh1tnOFDxrYCA-DKxnLiXrOXYug/edit?usp=sharing), or in the table below.

### How to use

The Artsdata Event Type controlled vocabulary is used along with the schema.org Event type.  An Event in Artsdata is a http://schema.org/Event (`schema:Event` or `schema:EventSeries`) and optionally an additional type from the Artsdata Event Controlled Vocabulary using the `schema:additionalType` property.

For example: 

```
ex:Event1 a schema:Event ; 
schema:additionalType <http://kg.artsdata.ca/resource/PerformingArtsEvent> .
```

To implement schema:Event and schema:additionalType properties in your structured data, please consult Artsdata's [structured data templates](https://culturecreates.github.io/artsdata-data-model/gabarits-jsonld/README.html).

### Key Changes in Version 4.0

The Artsdata team has defined Version 4.0 of Artsdata’s controlled vocabulary for event types, in consultation with the Artsdata community group (see the [project report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XMi70zjJBwu_dMSPUhf_Po6pymYcOUvgSQxXwW9vXO4/edit?usp=sharing) ). 

The Artsdata Event types Controlled Vocabulary Version 4.0 marks a major step forward in aligning our data with sector best practices and enhancing semantic clarity. Initiated in response to widespread inconsistencies and conceptual overlaps in the previous version, this overhaul introduces a format-based categorization model that better supports linked open data applications and digital discoverability.

[This document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nvSysesvUv_ksaR31YaVhx0gHEHQySzjWwRr-zC7Cow/edit?usp=sharing) describes the guidelines that the Artsdata team followed in redesigning Artsdata’s controlled vocabulary for Event types, as well as the key changes made in Version 4.0.

Version 4.0 represents a significant overhaul compared to Version 3.4.5.

Genre-based types were deprecated. Although certain Event types were deprecated, their URIs will remain accessible for users of Version 3.4.5. A few discipline-based types were grandfathered in version 4.0, but are now annotated as “proposed for deprecation” in a subsequent version of the vocabulary.

Similarly, all `skos:exactMatch` semantic relationships with the Scène Pro discipline/genre taxonomy were removed.

New types were added, including PowWow, Competition, SaleEvent, SocialDance, AwardsEvent, Live Film Concert, FestivalSeries and TalkEvent.

URIs were changed for the following concepts: `adr:StorytellingPerformance` (from `Storytelling`), `adr:VarietyPerformance` (from `VarietyShow`), `adr:Class` (from `Classes`), `adr:TalkEvent` (from `Conference`) and `adr:ResidencyEvent` (from `ResidencyActivity`).

Due to confusion surrounding altLabels during community feedback, this overhaul added the `skos:hiddenLabel` property, and began using this property along with skos:altLabels.

Labels and definitions were harmonized to make terminology and syntax consistent.

Some eventType definitions now include scope notes with the property “skos:scopeNote” to provide “encyclopedic” information useful to the user, as well as “skos:editorialNote” to convey background information about reasoning and possible future edits predicted for Version 5.0.

The subclass hierarchy for certain types was updated. For example, PreshowTalk and PostshowTalk became subclasses of a new TalkEvent class.

A spreadsheet detailing all the changes made between Version 3.4.5 and Version 4.0 can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cwNQIHcU0iBUi2dLdh1tnOFDxrYCA-DKxnLiXrOXYug/edit?usp=sharing).

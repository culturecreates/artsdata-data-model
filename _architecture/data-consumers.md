Data Consumers use the data in Artsdata.ca to create listing sites, enrich data in their CMS, or build recommendation engines and intelligent assistants.

Google is an indirect data consumer of the Event JSON-LD published on individual web sites with the [Footlight](footlight.html) code snippet. Artsdata.ca maps to Schema.org vocabularies for this reason.
